I submitted this today to copyright@github.com
DMCA counter notice against https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-06-23-Kiss.md


I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.
 
The disabled content was my entire repository https://github.com/actsl/kiss_sdl .
 
[Private, my name, physical address, telephone and email]
I'm a citizen of EU.
 
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
 
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
